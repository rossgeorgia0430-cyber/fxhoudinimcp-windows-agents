    to construct anything of 3+ nodes (massively faster than node-by-node
    calls, and either the whole network builds or nothing does).

    Every node type, parameter name, and input reference is validated
    against the running Houdini BEFORE anything is created; errors come
    back with did-you-mean suggestions. Use dry_run=True to prove a plan
    when using unfamiliar node types. The result includes cooked
    evidence: per-node errors and the display node's geometry counts —
    read them instead of assuming success.

    Each node spec dict supports:
        type (required), name, parms (lists set whole parm tuples),
        inputs (list of source names — earlier spec names, existing
        children, or absolute paths; or dicts with index/source/
        source_output), flags (display/render/bypass/template),
